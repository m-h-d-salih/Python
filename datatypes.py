# Python Numeric Literals
# Numeric Literals are immutable (unchangeable). Numeric literals can belong to 3 different numerical types: Integer, Float, and Complex.

# 1. Integer Literals
# Integer literals are numbers without decimal parts. It also consists of negative numbers. For example, 5, -11, 0, 12, etc.

# 2. Floating-Point Literals
# Floating-point literals are numbers that contain decimal parts.

# Just like integers, floating-point numbers can also be both positive and negative. For example, 2.5, 6.76, 0.0, -9.45, etc.

# 3. Complex Literals
# Complex literals are numbers that represent complex numbers.

# Here, numerals are in the form a + bj, where a is real and b is imaginary. For example, 6+9j, 2+3j.

# Python Boolean Literals
is_pass = True
print(is_pass)

# Output: True 

# Special Literal in Python
value = None

print(value)

# Output: None
